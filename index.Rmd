**More about me:**

I am a third-year doctoral student in the IMSE department at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). I am an Industrial Engineering student that use text mining techniques to incorporate client feedback into multiple-generation product pricing.
I collaborate with [Dr. Gul Kremer](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/directory/gul-kremer/) and [Dr. Sigurdur Olafsson](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/directory/profile/olafsson/).
I enjoy learning new things, and my preferred programming languages are **Python** and **R**.Â I'm interested in R packages, particularly those associated with visualization, such as ggplot2.
I earned a master's degree in IE from Sharif University of Technology. Being the past president of the Iranian Students and Scholars Association (ISSA) at Iowa State University, I have extensive experience working in teams and planning events.
I like to read books, run, and watch movies.
