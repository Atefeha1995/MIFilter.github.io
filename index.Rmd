**More about this package:**

This package helps with dimensional reduction (feature selection) in a dataset with highly correlated features to improve the classification performance and decrease the run time. This package requires `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `linear correlation` and `the mutual information (MI) threshold` as inputs, and returns `selected features list` and `the new reduced dataset`.


## Requirements

The following have to be installed and configured on the device in order
for `MIFilter` to work successfully.


- [R Statistical Computing Software, 2.1 or
  later](https://www.r-project.org/).

- Installation of the following packages for R:

  - `dataPreparation`
  - `magrittr`
  - `mpmi`
  - `plotly`
  - `shiny`
  - `stats`

## Installation

You can install the MIFilter from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Starwiiin/Corr_MIFiltering")
```


## Load library

``` r
library(MIFilter)
```

## Example

How do you use `MIFilter` package?

Read a dataset in that has the following columns:

-   `Features`: the data related to different features can be found on different columns.         These do not have to be named in an specific way.
-   `response variable`: A binary lable for each observation in the dataset.

The sample dataset is included in the package and you can read it and use it with the help of the Example page.
