**More about this package:**

This package helps with dimensional reduction (feature selection) in a dataset with highly correlated features to improve the classification performance and decrease the run time. This package requires `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `linear correlation` and `the mutual information (MI) threshold` as inputs, and returns `selected features list` and `the new reduced dataset`.
